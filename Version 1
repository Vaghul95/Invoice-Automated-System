A leading departmental store wants to acquire an automated tool for managing
orders. The order is made on behalf of a registered customer. An order consists of a
number of items in the stock. The system should keep track of the stock level of
each item. The order is either pending or serviced. The order is serviced only if the
stock level meets the request. An invoice is made at the time of servicing the order.
Customer can make a payment by using debit / credit card or net banking.
